"""
 if I were to make a guess, under the assumption of only using the crib "heil shakes" it would take around a hour to 12 hours minimum, a month at maximum. 

 https://brilliant.org/wiki/enigma-machine/#:~:text=Alan%20Turing%20and%20Gordon%20Welchman,send%20a%20given%20coded%20message.

 this source says that the Bombe machine was able to crack enigma in 20 mins. which is pretty similar to the 1 - 12 hours guess I gave, as the Bombe machine didn't just use "hail hitler", but also normally used "weather report" 
 the Bombe had 36 enigma machines running at once

with the extra rotors the extra amounts of permuations of the rotors alone is 5 x 4 x 3 = 60

# Pearl harbor was probably highphenated in the original message, so the japense probably did not shift the letters on the new word, this can be seen on the A's in Pearl Harbor vs Attack
