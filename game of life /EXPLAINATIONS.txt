A 
Slow evolve is the function for implementing without convolve, it uses pad arrays to help simulate infintes with wrap and fill
in the circumstance of wrap a cells neibors for the a edge is the oppsoite edge 
in the circumstance of fill a cells neibors are dead

it can generally run to around 1500 without any issues

PLEASE BE ADVISED I have put a pause start mechanism in test_gameoflife_grider to see the conways inserting for issues


B
I can verify it works correctly because the glider is running and moving


C
glider gun had two points of issue
implemented pause funciton to help find it

D 

I constructed 3 different formations using the advised format, these are important to question H

CC_semi_cenark 24 × 26
https://conwaylife.com/wiki/CC_semi-cenark

this is a type of reverser, this is important to the creation of tape and binary in a computer 

Bistable_switch 30 × 48
https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Bistable_switch

this is a complex version of memory, there is simpler versions but they are smaller then 20 x 20

max 27 × 27
https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Max

this is one of the creations used to large displays of computers in GOL



E
method still uses the kernal, hoever it uses a inert function from scipy signal that allows for grid to be 3000 and above to 
do simulate with little lag, I also did some changes to the number system to speed up both versions. Specifically I
swithed the types used for each cell from int64 (inefficient we dont need all those numbers) to byte reducing the casting to byte by the interpretor

it should also be brung up that there is Other optimisations that could have been done 

- usage of sparce representation instead of grid representation
- usage of lazy loading. i.e we are currently checking all the grid, but parts of the grid prospectively 
could have no cells like a 1/4 quarter unfilled

this kind of glider is used in the GOL turing machine

inverter 25 - 21

to have a turning machine you need a not gate, this show how a interting happens in a GOL turing machine

twoguns 40 x 26
https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Gosper_glider_gun
this shows how when 2 - 3 gliders hit eacher in certain ways they anihilate each other, it also show cases a glider eater

G 

seems to work, larger then 1750 cells on screen at once

Given the Turing machine pattern runs within GoL, comment on whether GoL is Turing complete. 
Justify your answer by referencing the theory of Turing machines and the different components 
of the Turing machine pattern provided using this link.

 - TURING TAPE 
    http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tmdetails.htm#TURING_TAPE
    the tape is implemented with 2 stacks which is the general methodology for implementing a syntheically infinite tape 
    - STACK 
        http://rendell-attic.org/cgi-bin/gol/gen_jsAnimation.pl?pattern=stacksm.rle&x0=-5&y0=-5&zoom=4&colors=3&height=970&width=201&grid=4
        uses multiple stack cells together to create the 'infinte' tape

        - POP CONTROL
            http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tmdetails.htm#POP_CONTROL
            does the pop method in a stack 

        - PUSH CONTROL
            http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tmdetails.htm#PUSH_CONTROL
            does the push method in a stack 

- FINITE STATE MACHINE  
    http://rendell-attic.org/cgi-bin/gol/gen_jsAnimation.pl?pattern=fsm.lif&x0=-5&y0=0&zoom=4&colors=3&height=802
    the fsm design is made modularly, meaing it is able to be extended with relative ease. it takes Information to and from the SIGNAL DETECTOR
    which is being read and wrote. 

- SIGNAL DETECTOR
    http://rendell-attic.org/cgi-bin/gol/gen_jsAnimation.pl?pattern=sigdet.lif&x0=10&y0=0&zoom=3&colors=3&height=700
    this connects the turing tape to the finite state machine allowing for memory, it does this by connecting the space ships from the fsm
    and gliders from the feed tape and adds corresponding motions and translations for each 


first off to define a set of criterian for turing machine (theory of turing machines)

- a finite state machine, that has a transition function with infite memory with actions that can be taken based on input and the current state. 
i.e a prospectively infite tape of 1's and 0's with a read and write head, connected to a set of instructions (state registers). 

This criterian is passes as a turing machine in GOL, the STACK can write to with POP AND PUSH as a abstraction of a infinte tape,
 and the Signal detector can read state, and the FSM can be used to store actions to be done.
Thus meaning that by those criterian in spite of the fact that this is a abstraction/simulation ran on a computer, it is turing complete.
